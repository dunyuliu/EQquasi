Close an item by deleting it, and record what was learned where it will be
read again: `PROJECT_RULES.md` for a rule, `data/<bench>/README.md` for a
benchmark finding, a commit message for a fix. Closed rows and the findings
behind them (BP8 domain and boundary study, step-over science, caps, known
limits) are in `docs/dev/board_history.md`. Rules are in `PROJECT_RULES.md`;
build, run and traps are in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Open

1. [ ] **P1 -- PETSc scaling in EQquasi.** Owner, 2026-10-09. Known today:
   native MUMPS scales 1.9x over 1->8 ranks (BP5); 10 m BP8 wide box ~15 s/step
   at 8 ranks, ~79 GB of factors; CG+GAMG scales better but is slower at every
   size tried (1.4x bp1002, 7.7x kink300); faulting and BP8 pore pressure run
   on rank 0 only. Steps, in order:
   (a) profile per-step time (solve / faulting+pressure / communication / I/O)
   at 8, 16, 32 ranks on 10 m BP8 wide and bp1002, host to ourselves;
   (b) MUMPS block-low-rank compression, ParMETIS ordering, threaded BLAS per
   rank; (c) hypre BoomerAMG vs tuned GAMG with the setup reused across steps
   (K is constant); (d) distribute the rank-0 work only if (a) says it matters.
   Done when: 10 m BP8 wide <= 5 s/step at 32 ranks, or a measured reason it
   cannot be, with parity to the gold at every change.
   Evidence: the per-step table from (a) and the final run's runInfo.json.
2. [ ] **P2 -- FEniCSx feasibility spike.** Owner, 2026-10-09. Not a port: a
   one-fault quasi-static prototype (BP5 or BP8) outside src/, in runs/, to
   answer three questions before any port is considered: can split-node (or
   interface) fault slip with rate-and-state be done cleanly; do P2 elements
   close the BP8 gap to Kim that linear hexes leave (depth -18 % at 50 m,
   -13 % at 10 m); what does a step cost against EQquasi on the same problem.
   Uses the host's fenicsx conda env; no new file in the repo until the
   answer says so (rule 1). Done when: a one-page verdict with numbers, under
   docs/dev/, and a go / no-go for a port.
